Hello, it's Prachaya here

This is my internship project currently working in 2024 with NARIT
It aim to create a working algorithm that is able to predict and classified of sky in each conditions

## Methodology

I've been working on the machine learning model, which I aim to present scalability and customability
While I previously create an unsupervised model based on dataset generated from raw image data.
I created some important method for further training and testing to evaluation of dataset in training and testing model

# Prinmary source
For all of this to happen, I would like to thanks to Scikit-learn developing team and Opencv team, who contribute many valuable
methods for the program and create other functions
